**Shapash** is a Python library which aims to make machine learning interpretable and understandable by everyone.
It provides several types of visualization that display explicit labels that everyone can understand. 

Data Scientists can understand their models easily and share their results. End users can understand the decision proposed by a model using a summary of the most influential criteria.

Shapash also contributes to data science auditing by displaying usefull information about any model and data in a unique report.
